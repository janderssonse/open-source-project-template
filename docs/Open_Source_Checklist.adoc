== About
It is easy to overlook a few important tasks when releasing and enhancing an Open Source Project.
This checklist is here to assist your project with suggestions.

Use this checklist practically - as a discussion starter for the project and as a foundation for future improvements.

== Documentation

* Ensure that the project complies with the basic conventions of Community Health Files (CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, etc.). +
Please refer to the link:.././README.md[README.md - Template Files Explanation Section] for a basic list and further information.

* Include any relevant usage documentation and software architecture descriptions concerning the project.

== Workflows

* Discuss your GitHub-workflow - a brief summary and suggestion can be found in link:../CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING - Pull Request Lifecycle]

== Project Quality

* Verify that the project has undergone a code review.
* Discuss and establish the project's testing goals and ambitions.

== Release and Versioning

* Use semantic versioning and release tags

== Naming and Trademarks Check

* Ensure that the project name does not conflict with an existing project or infringe on trademarks
** Conduct a general search engine check for the proposed project name.
** Perform a https://www.prv.se/en/ip-professional/trademarks/trademark-databases/[Trademark Search]
+
NOTE: It might be perfectly acceptable to use a name reminiscent of an existing trademark if the existing trademark is used for other services/areas and is not recognized as a well-known trademark.

== Legal and Licensing

* Ensure that the project's license does not conflict with third-party licenses.
* Declare the licenses for resources other than code (images, text, etc.).

== Security

* For Security details regarding GitHub-usage or Contributor-specific security, see (Under-Construction: How we work on GitHub and link:../CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING]

== People & Maintenance
* Ensure there is a maintenance and archival plan (if the project becomes non-maintained).
* Ensure that any maintaining team has gotten some education or experience regarding working Open Source
* Ensure that any maintaining team has a plan for handling community issues (responding to issues, reviewing and merging pull requests)
* Is there a need for a release plan? If so, ensure that is clear how it should be announced and promoted
* Every project README MUST have a ``Maintainer'' header. Wheter it's a team, an individual, or a role, does not matter.
* If no Maintainers are found, the project SHOULD be archived.
** Additionally, the project SHOULD use a CODEOWNERS-file.
  A CODEOWNERS-file can provide more granualarity in describing project maintenance, whereas the READMEâ€™s Maintainer heading might be more general.
== Open Source Excellence

There are a few additional actions you might want to consider.
These will help your Open Source Project to be collaborative, reusable, accessible, and up-to-date.
